Brainio – The Single Place for Human–AI Co-Creation
The Problem
AI tools are everywhere, but the work they produce — text, code, designs, workflows — is scattered.
Prompts, outputs, and useful AI-assisted workflows end up buried in chat logs, personal files, and disconnected apps.
Teams can’t easily reuse what’s been done, share it across projects, or build on each other’s progress.
The Solution
Brainio is the single place where humans and AI create, store, and reuse all kinds of work — not just text or documents, but any artifact:
Notes, mind maps, and documents


AI-generated outputs from any model (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, custom agents)


Prompts and extracted instructions


Templates for repeated tasks or workflows


Micro-apps built directly in Brainio with Appbeelder



Key Capabilities
Unified Artifact Hub


Stores human-made, AI-made, and co-created artifacts in one structured, searchable space.


Keeps provenance: who/what created it, when, and from which prompt.


Prompt & Template Database


Saves all prompts given to AI.


Automatically extracts instructions from conversations.


Lets you save them as reusable templates with one click.


Integrated Micro-App Builder (Appbeelder)


Build Streamlit apps directly inside Brainio.


Apps can be used by people or exposed as MCP tools for AI agents.


Multi-Human–AI Collaboration


Multiple people can contribute before AI generates the next version.


Ideal for design sprints, R&D, and creative problem-solving.



Market Fit
Target users


Enterprise R&D and innovation teams


Creative professionals and technical teams using multiple AI tools


Educators and collaborative research groups


Pain points solved


Scattered AI outputs across tools


Lost or untracked prompts and instructions


Lack of structure in AI-assisted work


No way to turn past work into reusable workflows or tools



Why Now
The last few years have seen an explosion in AI usage, but it’s mostly individual-first — everyone has their own chats, prompts, and outputs.
 Just as Slack replaced scattered company messaging (email, Skype, IRC) with a single, organized, searchable workspace, Brainio replaces scattered AI knowledge and outputs with a single, structured, and actionable workspace.
Timing factors:
Teams are moving from experimenting with AI to integrating it into daily work


Enterprises need compliance, provenance, and structure for AI-assisted workflows


Multi-human–AI collaboration is an untapped opportunity



Monetization Path
Following the growth playbooks of Slack, Notion, and Deepnote:
Start with small teams and early adopters who use AI daily


Drive viral adoption through sharing and collaboration features


Expand to enterprise-wide deployments with advanced features for security, compliance, and integrations

Why Us
Product foundation already exists – Brainio as a desktop app with mind maps, structured notes, and file support


Deep technical expertise – We’ve built AI agent frameworks, the Appbeelder micro-app builder, and protocols like ACP, with deep MCP and A2A knowledge


Unique integration layer – We can connect to any AI model or agent and make its outputs first-class citizens in Brainio


Focus on multi-human–AI collaboration – We design for teams, not just individuals, making us well positioned for enterprise adoption



In One Sentence
Brainio is where all your human–AI work lives — organized, searchable, reusable — so teams can co-create anything from a note to a working app, all in one place.

Pitch Sentence
Brainio is the single place for human–AI co-creation — where teams can create, store, and reuse everything they build with AI, from notes and mind maps to code, prompts, and working micro-apps, all in one organized, searchable workspace.

Positioning Diagram – Brainio vs. Others

Here’s the data-backed positioning diagram after scoring each competitor on four concrete “Centralization” criteria:
Centralization score (max 10) is the sum of:
Cross-AI ingestion – Can it pull outputs from multiple AI tools/models?


Prompt history storage – Can it store prompts with context?


Artifact variety – Can it store multiple output types (code, docs, diagrams, apps)?


Structure & searchability – Can it organize and search outputs effectively?


Collaboration score (0–10) reflects how well it supports multi-user workflows, especially with AI in the loop.

Key takeaway from the diagram:
Brainio is the only product in the top-right quadrant — maximum centralization and high collaboration.


Notion is collaborative but doesn’t centralize AI work well.


ChatGPT/Claude are decent at centralizing within their own silo but have almost no collaboration features.


Tools like Miro, Xmind, MindMeister are highly collaborative for humans but almost useless for AI centralization.





Technical ideas/comments
AppBeelder - each app an MCP server, so agents and humans can use them
Would love to have tools such as “extract all instructions from our conversation and save to Brainio as a prompt/template”
Brainio should have a library of prompts, versioned
